# PrivateMessenger
An extremely basic Android Application that makes use of Google's Firebase to send/receive messages and Firebase Cloud Messaging to send notifications to users.

## Notes:
* This was a self-learning project.
* If cloning, you'll need to add your own google-services.json file to the solution.
* You'll also need to run `firebase init` and `firebase deploy` to create your functions instance.
